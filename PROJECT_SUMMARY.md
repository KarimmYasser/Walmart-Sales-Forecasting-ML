# 📊 Walmart Sales Forecasting - Project Summary

**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025  
**Current Status:** Step 1.2 Completed

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### **Step 1.1: Data Loading & Merging** ✅
- ✅ Loaded 4 datasets (train, test, stores, features)
- ✅ Merged datasets properly with LEFT JOIN strategy
- ✅ Created `train_merged.csv` (421,570 rows × 16 columns)
- ✅ Created `test_merged.csv` (115,064 rows × 15 columns)
- ✅ Validated data quality (0 duplicates, proper merges)
- ✅ Documented all steps in `DOCUMENTATION.md`

### **Step 1.2: Handling Missing Values** ✅
- ✅ Analyzed missing patterns (MarkDown columns 64-74% missing)
- ✅ Implemented dual strategy:
  - Filled MarkDown columns with 0
  - Created 5 binary indicator columns (Has_MarkDown1-5)
- ✅ Achieved 100% data completeness
- ✅ Created `train_cleaned_step2.csv` (421,570 rows × 21 columns)
- ✅ Added 5 new predictive features
- ✅ Updated documentation

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### **1. Missing Value Strategy**
- **Decision:** Dual approach for MarkDown columns
- **Rationale:** 
  - Fill with 0: Represents "no promotion" accurately
  - Binary indicators: Capture "presence vs absence" signal
  - Both features useful for different model types
- **Result:** 5 new features added, 0 missing values remaining

### **2. Data Quality**
- **Negative Sales:** Kept (1,285 cases, representing returns)
- **All Rows Retained:** No data loss
- **Column Expansion:** 16 → 21 columns (new features)

## 🔜 Next Steps

### **Immediate Next: Step 1.3 - Outlier Detection**

**Objectives:**
1. Analyze negative sales (1,285 cases)
2. Detect extreme values using statistical methods
3. Visualize distributions
4. Decide on treatment strategy

**Planned Actions:**
- Box plots by store type
- IQR method for outlier detection
- Scatter plots of sales vs features
- Document findings and decisions

---

### **Remaining Steps in Milestone 1:**

**Step 1.4: Feature Engineering**
- Extract time features (Year, Month, Week, Quarter, etc.)
- Create lag features (previous week sales)
- Create rolling statistics (moving averages)
- Create interaction features

**Step 1.5: Encoding Categorical Features**
- One-hot encode Store Type (A, B, C)
- Handle Store and Dept IDs
- Finalize feature set for modeling

## 💡 Key Insights So Far

1. **Data Quality:** High quality dataset, minimal issues
2. **Missing Values:** Strategic (promotional markdowns), not quality problems
3. **Business Logic:** ~30% of weeks have promotions
4. **Sales Range:** -$4,989 to $693,099 (wide variance)
5. **Seasonality:** Holidays show significant impact (Feb 12 spike)

## 🎓 What We've Learned

### **About the Data:**
- Walmart tracks sales weekly by store-department combination
- External factors (temperature, fuel, economy) are included
- Promotional markdowns are not constant (strategic timing)
- Returns/clearances cause negative sales (normal business)

### **About the Task:**
- This is a **time series forecasting** problem
- Must predict future sales (test data) using past patterns (train data)
- Test data is real historical data with sales hidden for evaluation
- Final goal: Build model to predict 115,064 future sales values
